HAMMING NUMBER CALCULATOR
-------------------------

Hamming number is a number that can be written by 2,3 and 5.( for example 15=2^0 x 3 x 5 ).With this calculator we can calculate sum of all hamming numbers in a range that user
inputs.


steps:
1.First user inputs a number range that is separated by a space.
2.Checking if the input is following the format given else printing a error message
3.If input is following the format, using split we get the first and second number of the input.
4.After we check if the first number is less than second if not printing a error message.
5.If every condition is passed then we go through the range and using if_hamming function we will recognize hamming numbers and get the sum of them.
6.After calculating it will be printed.

Example input1:

Enter your number range(example: 1 6): 1 6
Sum of the hamming numbers: 21

Example input2:

Enter your number range(example:1 6): 1,4
Input the range separated by a space.
